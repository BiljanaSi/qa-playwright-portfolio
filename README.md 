### 📊 Test Reporting (Playwright HTML Report)

This project uses Playwright to generate a detailed, interactive HTML report after each test run. This report provides deep insights, error messages, and artifacts (like screenshots and videos) for failed tests.

**To view the latest generated report:**

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary packages are installed.
    
    npm install
    
2.  **Run the Tests:** Execute your test script (which generates the report files).
  
    npm run test:ui:report 
    # Or your basic test command: npx playwright test

3.  **Open the Report in Browser:** Use the Playwright CLI command to launch the report on a local server.
   
    npx playwright show-report

This command will automatically open the full, interactive report in your default web browser.
